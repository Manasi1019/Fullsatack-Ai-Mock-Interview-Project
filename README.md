# 🤖 AI Mock Interview Platform

An AI-powered web platform that simulates real job interviews using voice input and dynamically generated questions tailored to specific domains such as Web Development, Java, Python, etc. It provides real-time feedback to help users improve their interview skills.

## 📌 Features

-  **Dynamic Question Generation** using Google Gemini AI
-  **AI-Powered Feedback** on spoken answers
-  **Speech Recognition** for voice-based input
-  **Camera Activation** to simulate real interview environment
-  **Domain Selection** for personalized mock interview sessions
-  **Real-Time Evaluation** and suggestions for improvement
-  **Secure Authentication** via Clerk
-  **Firebase Integration** for real-time database
-  **Hosted on Vercel** for fast and scalable deployment

## 📌 Technologies Used

| Technology         | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ReactJS + TypeScript | Frontend development                           |
| Shadcn UI          | UI components and styling                        |
| Clerk              | Authentication and user management               |
| Google Gemini AI   | Dynamic question generation and feedback         |
| Web Speech API     | Speech-to-text conversion                        |
| Firebase Firestore | Real-time database                               |
| Vercel             | Hosting and deployment                           |

## 📌 System Architecture

The system is modular and includes:

- **Frontend UI**: Built with React + TypeScript
- **AI Backend Integration**: Fetches dynamic questions from Google Gemini AI
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts user answers to text
- **Answer Evaluation**: NLP comparison with ideal answers
- **User Dashboard**: Tracks past performance and feedback

> Note: Camera remains active during interviews to simulate realism, but **no facial expression or body language tracking** is performed.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **User selects domain** (e.g., Java, Python)
2. **Interview begins**: Camera and microphone activate
3. **AI generates questions** in real-time
4. **User responds verbally**
5. **System evaluates** the answer using NLP
6. **Feedback is provided** on the spoken content
7. **Results and suggestions** are shown to help improve


## 📌 Use Cases

- Students and job seekers practicing for interviews
- Educational platforms providing interview coaching
- Remote interview simulations
- Self-assessment for communication and soft skills


## 📌 Future Scope

- 📄 Resume analysis and keyword suggestions
- 🗣️ Real-time voice modulation feedback
- 🕹️ Gamification with badges/leaderboards
